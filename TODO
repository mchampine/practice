practice branching and merging

How:

git branch experment
git checkout experiment
<add files>
<change files>
git add <new files>
git commit -am 'new stuff'

git checkout master
<make and commit changes>

git checkout experiment
git push origin experiment //push this new branch to the server.

git checkout master
git merge experiment
<resolve conflicts if necessary>
<add and commit>

git branch -d experiment //delete when done with it

Note: had to add new remote to push after corruption/clone:
Note: did this edit on github. Seem to have lost edit ability now.
git remote add private git@github.com:mchampine/practice.git
git push private master  //push master to new remote
